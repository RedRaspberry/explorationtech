fix crafting recipes for gunpowder to include the reliquary drops
change recipe of wizardry bookshelves to not require grand magic crystals
make grand magic crystals more easily obtainable (??)
look into how thaumcraft infusion and/or botania infusion works, and make recipes for all 7 elemental crystals using it
(nvm, the infusion altar from wiz itself can do this. instead, make that more easially obtainable, and/or breakable (how!))
also use that to make other useful, later game items for cross mod compat
rustic fences do not have fence oredict tag.
change futureMC composter recipe to match vanilla.

change netherrite to not alloy in the actual crafting table, instead in [insert alloy machine here]
remove flim-flam enchantment (for some reason, you can still get it on advanced enchant tables, so that's probably a blacklist in the config?)
generally work on finding more cross-mod compat options
mess with loot tables!

give sawdust pulpwood oredict and itemsawdust on both mek and thermal versions
runic altar recipe for quark runes: mystical petal of color you want + managlass + %s vis crystal + fluix crystal + bottle o' enchanting

Fix MGC crushing table to use any ingot -> plate crafting; remove vanilla-style&hammer crafting recipes for plates; fix recipe output of crushing table to supply thermal plates instead of immersive
fix unidict configs to prevent this from happening


retexture railcraft plates to match other mods; retexture fluxed electrum plate to match new thermal

think about tutorial/questbook to explain progression
remove smithing table from smeltery recipes (it melts into iron!!!?)

add mgc smithing table recipes for ore crushing

replace all instances of iron ingots in engineering blocks with plates

create some sort of machine to process metal rods into wires
remove rod crafting recipes
add rod crafting for tinkers'
remove wire crafting in metal process
add wire crafting on mgc crushing table from rods


remove railcraft steel armor and tools, thermal steel armor and tools, and tinkers steel armor and tools
remove most thermal [x type of metal] armor and tools - it's boring and useless
make immersive steel more priority than thermal in unidict config


add crafting recipes for aether mod pillars

add runic altar recipes for spawn eggs ???

high flux levels spawns pipers from rat mod

Disable enchantments in advanced enchantment table completely:
flimflam
remove from most items :
autosmelt
~~~

LootTableTweaker:
remove most of enderio's loot items, minus the capacitors



Conflicts:
Thermal and Railcraft steel shears
quark and netherEX red nether brick slab
ticomplement stone bucket and wrcbe stone bowl
there are 3 sets of steel armor - railcraft, thermal, tinkers tcomplement; there is also the immersive one that uses steel plates instead
whatever mess is going on with the compatibility between various gear types
same issue with bronze armor as with steel
CC modem and futura block
iron and gold rings conflict with those gear types
carrot and potato bags conflict with rat mod assorted vegatables
nether respawn obelisk conflicts with... lots of things
~~~

there's probably thermal / railcraft / immersive / ti complement / tinkers versions of metal tools that SHOULD conflict but perhaps don't share recipes. either way; ensure there's only one version of each for balance and avoiding confusion
