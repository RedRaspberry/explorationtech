fix crafting recipes for gunpowder to include the reliquary drops
change recipe of wizardry bookshelves to not require grand magic crystals
make grand magic crystals more easily obtainable (??)
look into how thaumcraft infusion and/or botania infusion works, and make recipes for all 7 elemental crystals using it
(nvm, the infusion altar from wiz itself can do this. instead, make that more easially obtainable, and/or breakable (how!))
also use that to make other useful, later game items for cross mod compat
rustic fences do not have fence oredict tag.
change futureMC composter recipe to match vanilla.

change netherrite to not alloy in the actual crafting table, instead in [insert alloy machine here]
remove flim-flam enchantment (for some reason, you can still get it on advanced enchant tables, so that's probably a blacklist in the config?)
generally work on finding more cross-mod compat options
mess with loot tables!
